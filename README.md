# RNAPI-model-v2
Computational model simulating RNA polymerase I transcription (update 2023)


## Software
The model was run in Matlab, and can be run using software accepting parallel computing i.e. Matlab (require Parallel Computing Toolbox) or Octave (free license, interprets `parfor` as `for`).

## Runninig simulation

To run simulation user have to provide a `runParameters.csv` file. Example has been attached to this repository (`runParameters_example.csv`).

To execute simulation run `RunModels.m` script.

Output data will be stored in `Data` folder.
